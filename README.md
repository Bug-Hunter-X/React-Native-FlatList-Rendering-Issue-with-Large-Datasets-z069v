# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common rendering issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets.  The issue manifests as inconsistent rendering during fast scrolling, leading to blank spaces or incorrect items being displayed. 

## Bug Description

The `FlatListBug.js` file contains a sample implementation that reproduces the problem. When you scroll quickly through the list, you'll notice that some items are missing or incorrectly rendered. This is due to performance limitations and how FlatList handles item rendering and recycling.

## Solution

The `FlatListBugSolution.js` file provides a solution using `windowSize` and `maxToRenderPerBatch` props, along with potentially improving data fetching or rendering efficiency. The `windowSize` property improves initial render performance and scrolling smoothness.  `maxToRenderPerBatch` helps to reduce the load on the main thread and improve overall performance.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the app.
5. Scroll quickly through the FlatList. Observe the rendering inconsistencies.

## Solution Implementation

The solution implemented in `FlatListBugSolution.js` optimizes rendering by adjusting `windowSize` and `maxToRenderPerBatch` to control the number of items rendered at once. Experimentation with these values may be needed depending on the specific dataset and hardware limitations.
